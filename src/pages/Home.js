              <p>
                Every session is one-on-one and tailored to your child's unique needs. We provide a thorough review of necessary documentation and parent and child interviews to understand how we can best support your child. We draw on the Science of Reading, a deep understanding of language development, and the critical connection between language and executive functioning. Our sessions are then structured to be supportive, and engaging and are designed to build real-world skills that carry over into everyday life and the classroom. Whether we're working on comprehension, writing, organization, or flexible thinking, our goal is to meet your child where they are and help them move forward with confidence. <a href="/process" className="feature-link">(Learn more about process)</a>
