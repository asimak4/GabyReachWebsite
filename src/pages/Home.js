                  Every session is one-on-one and tailored to your child's unique needs. We provide a thorough review of 
                  necessary documentation and parent and child interviews to understand how we can best support your child. 
                  We draw on the Science of Reading, a deep understanding of language development, and the critical connection 
                  between language and executive functioning. Our sessions are then structured to be supportive, and engaging 
                  and are designed to build real-world skills that carry over into everyday life and the classroom. Whether 
                  we're working on comprehension, writing, organization, or flexible thinking, our goal is to meet your child 
                  where they are and help them move forward with confidence.
